## Preference Packs / Configuration Files
Any help making proposals for new default configurations would be greatly appreciated.  

Please start with a clean configuration, and create a pull request with your modified `FreeCAD.conf` and `user.cfg` files when you are happy. Create a directory with your files in `/config_files/`, and add a .md or .txt file with a short description of your modifications and rationale.
